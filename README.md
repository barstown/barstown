# Human User Guide for Kyle Barstow

## Reference
This Human User Guide and some of the concepts within it were directly inspired by some of the content
shared in this GitHub blog post titled
[How to communicate like a GitHub engineer](https://github.blog/2023-10-04-how-to-communicate-like-a-github-engineer-our-principles-practices-and-tools/), and the
accompanying GitHub [repository](https://github.com/github/how-engineering-communicates).

## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* I work to live, not live to work, even though many of my hobbies and interests overlap with my career.
* A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine.

### What drives you nuts?
* Inconsistency raises questions and uncertainty.
* Repeating myself. At best, my advice was forgotten; at worst, it was intentionally ignored.
* Breaking established processes reduces efficiency and increases errors.

### What are your quirks?
* I tend to over-explain when I am passionate about a topic.
* I am a proud nerd. My passion for learning and playing with open-source software technologies not only provides personal satisfaction but often translates to work. Ask me about my hobbies and interests, and feel free to share yours.
* Instant messaging should not be a source of escalation or referenceable decisions. People use it as an interrupt-based escalation and means to create false urgency when other communication streams such as tickets, notifications, and emails are poorly managed.

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* My lack of reaction should not be taken as a lack of care. Being reactionary is rarely advantageous.

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* Be reliable, consistent, and predictable by delivering tasks on time, adhering to workplace best practices, and providing all necessary information up front when requesting work.
* Respect the time of my team and I.

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
* Don't tag me in every chat message.
* [No hello](https://nohello.net/en/). Treat instant messaging as asynchronous communication — state your needs or information directly without expecting an immediate response.
* Avoid asking for unplanned, "under-the-table" work due to poor planning — it's disruptive.

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* Trust my expertise. Questions are encouraged, but telling me how to perform my job is disrespectful.

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
* Be curious, and dedicate time to learning.
* Share educational resources, deals, and encourage reading often.
* Always do your best and be proud of your work.

### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
* Written communication first, followed by scheduling a brief video or phone call to clarify any unclear points if necessary.

### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
* Show me data, examples, or write up a use case, pointing out the best, likely, and worst cases. Wanting something done because you "just want it that way" is not a sufficient justification to divert time away from more pressing tasks.

### How do you like to give feedback?
* I give feedback promptly after observation.
* Include an example that supports the feedback being given.

### How do you like to get feedback?
* Early and often.
* From anyone affected by my performance or behavior.
